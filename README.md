<div align="center">Signs is an easy-to-use, intuitive text tool plugin for creating signs, text, and labels.</div>

## Installation
Signs is avaliable on the **Creator Marketplace for 100 Robux** or from **GitHub for free**. There is a free version on the Roblox Marketplace also.

### Creator Marketplace (Recommended)
Installing from the [**Creator Marketplace**](https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/publishing/creator-marketplace) is what is recommened to install **Signs** or **Signs Free** and allows for **automatic updates** from Roblox and **easier installation**.

To install from the **Creator Marketplace** click the below link for the plugin version you want to install. Once at the page, click <kbd>**Get Plugin**</kbd> to install the plugin into **Roblox Studio**.

- [**Signs** (100 Robux)](https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/6967799394/)

- [**Signs Free** (Free)](https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/6967799394/)

### GitHub
Installing from [**GitHub**](https://github.com/about) allows you to access the full paid verion of Signs for free but **no automatic updates** due to limitations as well as a slightly harder installation.

To install from **GitHub** first download the lastest `.rbxm` plugin file of Signs from the below link. Once you have the file, go to `C:\Users\YOUR_WINDOWS_USER\AppData\Local\Roblox\Plugins` and insert `Signs.rbxm` (the one you downloaded) into that folder.
